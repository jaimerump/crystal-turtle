# crystal-turtle

This is me trying out [the turtle kata](https://github.com/jaimerump/turtle-kata) in [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/)

You can run it in the terminal by going to project root and running:

`crystal eval "require \"./lib/turtle_kata\"; TurtleKata.run_with_file(\"./logo_files/complex.logo\")"`
